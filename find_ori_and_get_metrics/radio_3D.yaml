# This is an example of a parameters file
# It is written according to the YAML-convention (www.yaml.org) and is checked by the code for consistency.
# Three types of parameters are possible and reflected in the structure of the document:
#
# Parameter category:
#   Setting Name: <value>
#
# The three parameter categories are:
# - setting: Setting to use for preprocessing and class specific settings. if no <value> is specified, the value for
#   this setting is set to None.
# - featureClass: Feature class to enable, <value> is list of strings representing enabled features. If no <value> is
#   specified or <value> is an empty list ('[]'), all features for this class are enabled.
# - imageType: image types to calculate features on. <value> is custom kwarg settings (dictionary). if <value> is an
#   empty dictionary ('{}'), no custom settings are added for this input image.
#
# Some parameters have a limited list of possible values. Where this is the case, possible values are listed in the
# package documentation

# Settings to use, possible settings are listed in the documentation (section "Customizing the extraction").
# setting:
#  binWidth:
#  label: 1
#  interpolator:  # This is an enumerated value, here None is not allowed
#  resampledPixelSpacing:
#  weightingNorm: # If no value is specified, it is interpreted as None
#  geometryTolerance:
#  normalize:

# Image types to use: "Original" for unfiltered image, for possible filters, see documentation.

#  #   # If the in-plane spacing is large (> 2mm), consider removing sigma value 1.
#    sigma: [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

# Featureclasses, from which features must be calculated. If a featureclass is not mentioned, no features are calculated
# for that class. Otherwise, the specified features are calculated, or, if none are specified, all are calculated.
